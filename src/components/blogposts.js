Ever since Starhopper I have been following SpaceX as they attempt to make the first fully reusable rocket Starship. However, all the progress has been at StarBase in remote Boca Chica, Texas. Thanks to the hard work of Youtube channels like MarcusHouse and NASASpaceFlight, I have been able to get daily updates on the construction of Starbase, each Starship iteration and even static fires. If you want to learn more about how SpaceX is planning on making life multiplanetary I highly recommend these two Youtube channels.

    title: 'Congrats to SpaceX on a successful test of the most powerful rocket ever!',

On April 17, 2023 SpaceX performed the first integrated test flight of Starship, the most powerful and fully reusable rocket ever! Even though the rocket ultimately was commanded to self destruct 6-minutes into the flight, the mission was a success! But why? It blew up didn't it? Itâ€™s important to note that this was a TEST for a first of its kind vehicle that is 2x times more powerful than the Saturn V rocket that brought humans to the Moon. The mission was successful because Starship cleared two important milestones for rockets.

-Liftoff
-Max q

Liftoff: The obvious first step for any rocket is to get off the launch pad. Starship is the most powerful rocket ever created so lifting off without a serious incident is a major milestone on its own.

Max q: This describes the point during flight where the rocket experiences the maximum dynamic pressure. Inturn this is the most dangerous point for any rocket and is the time where the vehicle is most likely to fail. Starship was able to survive max q which is a major achievement for a rocket of this scale.

Congratulations again to SpaceX for their successful test!`,

    title: 'Make your own UAV with Pixhawk',
    content:

I recently went down a YouTube rabbit hole and came across an amazing piece of technology. The Pixhawk is an advanced autopilot system used in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other robotic platforms. It provides precise navigation, control, and communication capabilities, allowing for autonomous flight and mission execution with a wide range of sensors and peripherals. What makes the Pixhawk unique is that it is essentially a plug and play piece of hardware that can turn nearly anything into a completely autonomous system with GPS waypoint route planning and automated adjustments to wind. Combining a Pixhawk powered drone or plane with machine learning can be used to aid a multitude of disciplines.

Possbile applications of Pixhawk+Machine learning:
- Wild fire tracking
- Agriculture tracking
- Land surveys
- Search and rescue

Someday soon I plan on exploring making my own UAVs and applying my knowledge of Computer Science to make a powerful tool for humanity.

Pixhawks kits can be found for as low as $90 and can be installed on almost any vehicle with proper knowledge. In the video linked above, someone made a fully autonomous drone out of sticks and ducktape!
